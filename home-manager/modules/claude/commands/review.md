Review the working changes that are uncommitted for issues. You should retrieve these working changes by running `git diffall`. Don't summarize the changes. You should focus on errors in logic, unwanted behavior and bugs. If you feel strongly that the changes are missing something that wouldn't necessarily qualify as a bug, feel free to point them out as well.
