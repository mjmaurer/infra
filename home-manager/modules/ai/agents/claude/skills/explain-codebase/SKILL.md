1. **Describe the motivation**: Give the purpose of the codebase. Compare and contrast to other similar software
2. **Describe high-level architecture**: Give a high-level overview of the architecture. Include any services that are required to run it and any high-level modules / design patterns that the codebase utilizes
2. **(OPTIONAL) Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
